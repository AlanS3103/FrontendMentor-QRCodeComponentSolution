## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS and SCSS
- Visual Studio Code (1.76.0)

### What I learned

This was my first contact with SCSS and this simple challenge made me get up the courage to test and build, now I'm going to use SCSS for more future projects as I find it very clean to understand and reorganize

### Continued development

I think the only changes or updates to be made with this project are about the design, maybe changing the size or something.
